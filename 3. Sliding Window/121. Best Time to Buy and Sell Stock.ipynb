      "source": "### Explanation:\n\n- The `maxProfit` function takes a single argument, `prices`, which is a list of stock prices.\n- The first line of the function checks if the `prices` list is empty. If it's empty, there are no prices to analyze, so the function returns 0 (no profit can be made).\n\n- Then, we initialize two variables:\n  - `min_price`: This variable will keep track of the minimum price seen so far. We initialize it with the price of the first day in the list (`prices[0]`).\n  - `max_profit`: This variable will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve. We initialize it to 0 because initially, we haven't made any profit.\n\n- We start iterating through the `prices` list, where `price` represents the stock price for the current day.\n\n- In each iteration, we check if the current `price` is lower than the `min_price` we've seen so far. If it is, we update `min_price` to the current `price`. This is because we want to buy the stock at the lowest possible price.\n\n- Next, we calculate the profit we would make if we sold the stock at the current `price` (assuming we bought it at `min_price`). We do this by subtracting `min_price` from the current `price`. This represents the profit for the current day.\n\n- We also use the `max` function to keep track of the maximum profit seen so far. If the profit calculated for the current day is greater than the `max_profit` we've seen previously, we update `max_profit` with this higher value.\n\n- Finally, after iterating through all the days in the `prices` list, we return `max_profit`, which represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a single stock.",

It performs a linear number of operations relative to the size of the input.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- The space complexity of the code is constant, O(1).\n- Regardless of the size of the input `prices` array, the code only uses a fixed amount of additional memory to store two variables (`min_price` and `max_profit`) and a few loop variables.\n- The memory usage does not depend on the size of the input, so it is considered constant space complexity.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `prices` array.\n- Space Complexity: O(1) (constant space usage).",
