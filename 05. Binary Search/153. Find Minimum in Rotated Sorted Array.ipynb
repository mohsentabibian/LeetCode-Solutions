        "1. The function `findMin(nums)` takes an input list `nums`, which represents the rotated sorted array.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to track the current search range. Initially, `left` is set to 0 (the beginning of the array), and `right` is set to `len(nums) - 1` (the end of the array).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Enter a `while` loop with the condition `left < right`. This loop continues until `left` and `right` converge to a single element, which will be the minimum element in the rotated array.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Inside the loop, calculate the middle index `mid` using integer division. This helps in finding the middle element of the current search range.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Check if the element at the middle index (`nums[mid]`) is greater than the element at the rightmost index (`nums[right]`). If this condition is true, it means that the minimum element must be in the right half of the current search range. So, update `left` to `mid + 1`, effectively eliminating the left half of the search range.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. If the condition from step 5 is not met, it implies that the minimum element can be in the left half of the current search range or could be the element at the `mid` index itself. In this case, update `right` to `mid`, effectively eliminating the right half of the search range.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Repeat steps 4-6 until `left` and `right` converge to the minimum element.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. When the loop exits, it means that `left` (or `right`) points to the minimum element in the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Return `nums[left]` (or `nums[right]`) as the result, which is the minimum element in the rotated sorted array."
