---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[0, 10^4]$.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
