      "source": "### Explanation:\n\n1. We start with a binary tree represented using a TreeNode class. Each node has a value (`val`) and can have a left child (`left`) and a right child (`right`).\n\n2. The `rightSideView` function takes the root node of the binary tree as input and returns a list of values representing the nodes you can see when standing on the right side of the tree.\n\n3. We check if the `root` is `None`, which means the tree is empty. If it's empty, we return an empty list because there are no nodes to see.\n\n4. We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the right side view values.\n\n5. We initialize a queue called `queue` with the root node. This queue is used for a level-order traversal of the tree.\n\n6. We enter a while loop that continues until the `queue` is empty. Inside this loop, we perform the following steps for each level of the tree:\n\n   a. We determine the number of nodes at the current level by getting the length of the `queue`. This is important for processing nodes at the same level together.\n\n   b. We then iterate through the nodes at the current level using a for loop. For each node in the level, we dequeue it from the `queue` using `queue.pop(0)`.\n\n   c. If the node we dequeue is the rightmost node at the current level (determined by `i == level_size - 1`), we add its `val` to the `result` list. This is because, when standing on the right side of the tree, you can see the rightmost node at each level.\n\n   d. We enqueue the left and right children of the current node (if they exist) to the `queue`. This ensures that we process the next level in the subsequent iterations of the while loop.\n\n7. After processing all levels of the tree, the `result` list contains the values of the rightmost nodes in each level, ordered from top to bottom.\n\n8. Finally, we return the `result` list as the output of the function, which represents the right side view of the binary tree.\n\nThe code effectively performs a level-order traversal of the binary tree while keeping track of the rightmost nodes at each level and adding them to the result list. This ensures that we obtain the correct order of nodes visible from the right side of the tree.",

Here's why:\n\n1. We perform a level-order traversal of the tree using a queue. In the worst case, we visit all nodes once, which takes O(N) time since we visit each node exactly once.\n\n2. For each node, we perform constant-time operations like dequeuing it from the queue, checking if it's the rightmost node at the current level, and enqueuing its children (if they exist). These operations do not depend on the size of the tree, so they do not contribute to the overall time complexity.\n\nTherefore, the dominant factor in the time complexity is the level-order traversal, making it O(N).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\nThe space complexity of the code is also O(N). Here's why:\n\n1. We use a queue to perform level-order traversal. In the worst case, the queue can contain all nodes at the maximum width of the tree, which can be up to N/2 nodes for a completely unbalanced tree. Therefore, the space required for the queue is O(N).\n\n2. The `result` list stores the values of the rightmost nodes. In the worst case, when the binary tree is a complete binary tree, it can have roughly N/2 rightmost nodes. Therefore, the space required for the `result` list is also O(N).\n\n3. Other auxiliary variables like `level_size`, `i`, and `node` require only constant space and do not depend on the size of the tree.\n\nCombining the space used by the queue and the `result` list, we get a space complexity of O(N).\n\nIn summary, the code has a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. These complexities are efficient and scale linearly with the size of the input tree.",
