It has three attributes:\n   - `val`: The value of the node.\n   - `left`: A reference to the left child node.\n   - `right`: A reference to the right child node.\n\n   This class is used to create instances of binary tree nodes, which will be used to build the binary tree.\n\n2. `def buildTree(preorder, inorder):`: This is the main function that constructs a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals.\n\n   - `preorder`: A list representing the preorder traversal of the binary tree.\n   - `inorder`: A list representing the inorder traversal of the binary tree.\n\n3. `if not preorder: return None`: This line checks if the `preorder` list is empty. If it is, it means there are no nodes to construct, so the function returns `None`.\n\n4. `root_val = preorder[0]`: The value of the root node is extracted from the first element of the `preorder` list.\n\n5. `root = TreeNode(root_val)`: A new `TreeNode` object is created with the `root_val` as its value. This represents the root of the current subtree.\n\n6. `root_idx_inorder = inorder.index(root_val)`: The index of the `root_val` in the `inorder` list is found. This index indicates the position of the root node in the inorder traversal.\n\n7. `root.left`: The left subtree is constructed recursively by calling the `buildTree` function with the appropriate sublists of `preorder` and `inorder`. The left subtree's preorder and inorder traversals are the slices of `preorder` and `inorder` lists up to the `root_idx_inorder`.\n\n8. `root.right`: The right subtree is constructed recursively by calling the `buildTree` function with the appropriate sublists of `preorder` and `inorder`. The right subtree's preorder and inorder traversals are the slices of `preorder` and `inorder` lists starting from `root_idx_inorder + 1`.\n\n9. Finally, the function returns the `root` of the subtree it just constructed.\n\nThe recursive approach used here divides the problem of constructing the entire binary tree into smaller subproblems, starting with the root node and then recursively building the left and right subtrees until the entire tree is constructed.",

This represents the value of the current node in the binary tree.\n\n    b. `queue.append(node.left)`: Enqueue the left child of the current node if it exists.

This adds the right child to the queue for processing in the next iteration.\n\n7. `else:`: If the `node` is None, it represents an empty node in the binary tree.\n\n    a. `result.append(None)`: Append `None` to the `result` list to indicate an empty node.\n\n8. `while result and result[-1] is None:`: After the traversal is complete, there might be trailing `None` values in the `result` list. This loop removes any such trailing `None` values to ensure a clean representation of the tree's elements.\n\n9. `return result`: Return the `result` list, which now contains the elements of the binary tree in a format where `None` represents empty nodes and the order of elements reflects a level-order traversal of the tree.\n\nIn summary, the `treeToList` function performs a level-order traversal of the binary tree using a queue, constructing a list where each element corresponds to a node's value or represents an empty node with `None`.

Let's assume there are `n` nodes in the binary tree.\n\n1. Finding the root value in the `preorder` traversal takes O(1) time as it's just extracting the first element from the list.\n2. Finding the index of the root value in the `inorder` traversal using `inorder.index(root_val)` takes O(n) time in the worst case because in the worst case, it might have to search through all `n` elements in the `inorder` list to find the index.\n3. The recursive calls to `buildTree` for the left and right subtrees are made once for each node in the tree. Therefore, the recursive calls have a combined time complexity of O(n) as they process each node once.\n\nThe total time complexity of the `buildTree` function is O(n) due to the recursive calls and finding the root's index in the `inorder` list.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\nThe space complexity is determined by the space used by the function's call stack during recursion and any additional data structures used. \n\n1. The space used by the function call stack during recursion depends on the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, where the tree is highly unbalanced (e.g., a skewed tree), the space complexity for the call stack is O(n) as it can go as deep as the number of nodes in the tree.\n\n2. Additionally, the function creates TreeNode objects for each node in the binary tree. Therefore, the space complexity for these objects is also O(n).\n\nOverall, the space complexity of the `buildTree` function is O(n) due to the space used by the call stack and the TreeNode objects.\n\nIn summary, the time complexity of `buildTree` is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the binary tree.",
