In the average case for a balanced BST, the space complexity is O(log N), but in the worst case (skewed tree), it can be O(N) due to the recursive call stack.\n\nIn summary, this code checks whether a given binary tree is a valid BST by recursively validating each node's value and its left and right subtrees while maintaining valid value ranges. If all nodes satisfy the BST properties, the tree is considered a valid BST.",

      "source": "## Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the time and space complexity of the `is_valid_BST` function:\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n- The time complexity of the function primarily depends on the number of nodes in the binary tree.\n- In the worst case, we may have to visit every node in the tree once to validate whether it's part of a valid BST.\n- Since we are performing a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- The space complexity is determined by the space used by the recursive call stack during the DFS traversal.\n- In the worst case, if the tree is completely unbalanced (a skewed tree), the maximum depth of the call stack would be equal to the height of the tree.\n- In a balanced BST, the height is approximately log2(N), where N is the number of nodes.\n- Therefore, the space complexity of the call stack is O(log N) for a balanced BST.\n- In the worst case (skewed tree), the space complexity can be O(N) as the height of the tree can be equal to N.\n\n**Overall:**\n- Time Complexity: O(N)\n- Space Complexity: O(log N) on average for a balanced BST, and O(N) in the worst case for a skewed tree.\n\nThe space complexity is typically dominated by the recursive call stack, and it varies depending on the shape of the binary tree. In practice, for balanced binary trees, the space complexity is often close to O(log N), which is quite efficient.",

For example, consider a binary tree with constraints like \"The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key,\" and \"The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.\" How would you adapt the code to handle these constraints?\n\n2. **Handling Duplicates**: Modify the code to handle binary search trees that allow duplicate values. In a standard BST, each value is unique, but in this case, multiple nodes can have the same value. The tree should still be considered valid if it follows the BST property.",
