        "\n",
        "The problem, \"Find Median from Data Stream,\" deals with efficiently computing the median of a sequence of numbers as they are incrementally provided. The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. When the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: You are asked to implement a `MedianFinder` class that supports the following operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `MedianFinder()`: Initializes the MedianFinder object.\n",
        "    - `addNum(int num)`: Adds an integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.\n",
        "    - `findMedian()`: Returns the median of all elements added to the data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Median Calculation**: The `findMedian` operation should efficiently compute the median, and the result should have a precision of at least $10^{-5}$ (i.e., answers within this range will be considered correct).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Examples**:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - If you add numbers [1, 2], the median should be 1.5 because (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5.\n",
        "   - If you add numbers [1, 2, 3], the median should be 2 because it's the middle value.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Constraints**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The integers provided in the data stream are in the range from $-10^5$ to $10^5$.\n",
        "   - There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.\n",
        "   - At most, $5 * 10^4$ calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem can be solved by using two priority queues (heaps): one max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and one min-heap to store the larger half of the numbers. The max-heap ensures that the largest number in the smaller half is at the top, and the min-heap ensures that the smallest number in the larger half is at the top. These heaps are balanced to efficiently find the median when requested.\n",

        "The code defines a `MedianFinder` class for efficiently finding the median of a stream of numbers. It uses two heaps: a max-heap (`small_half`) to store the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap (`large_half`) to store the larger half. Here's how the code works:\n",

        "1. The `__init__` method initializes the two heaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The `addNum` method adds a number to the appropriate heap, ensuring that the heaps remain balanced. It does this by comparing the number to the current maximum in the smaller half and adding it to the appropriate heap. Then, it checks the sizes of the two heaps and rebalances them if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The `findMedian` method calculates and returns the median. If both halves have the same size (even number of elements), it computes the average of the tops of both heaps. If the smaller half has more elements (odd number of elements), it returns the top of the max-heap, which is the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this code efficiently maintains two heaps to divide the elements into smaller and larger halves, allowing for quick median retrieval. It offers a time complexity of O(log N) for adding elements and O(1) for finding the median, where N is the total number of elements processed. The space complexity is O(1) as the space used by the two heaps is independent of the input size."
