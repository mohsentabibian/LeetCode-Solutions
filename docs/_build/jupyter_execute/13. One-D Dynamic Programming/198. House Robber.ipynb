    "The problem is a classic dynamic programming challenge known as the \"House Robber\" problem. The scenario is that you are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but the constraint is that adjacent houses have security systems connected. If two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night, the security systems will automatically contact the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. You need to find a strategy to maximize your earnings while avoiding robbing two adjacent houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the problem is an array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the amount of money in the `i`-th house. The task is to return the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without triggering the security system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).\n",
    "Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 12\n",
    "Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9), and rob house 5 (money = 1).\n",
    "Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge involves designing an algorithm to efficiently solve this problem and find the optimal strategy for robbing houses to maximize the stolen money while adhering to the constraint of not robbing adjacent houses. The provided solution utilizes dynamic programming to achieve this.\n",

    "## Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code is a Python implementation of the \"House Robber\" problem using a dynamic programming approach. It's part of a class `Solution` and includes a method `rob` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of the algorithm is to maintain two variables, `prev` and `curr`, which represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the previous house and the current house, respectively. The algorithm iterates through the houses, updating these variables based on the maximum amount that can be robbed at the current house, considering the constraint of not robbing adjacent houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop calculates a temporary variable `temp` that represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at the current house. It considers two scenarios: either robbing the current house and adding the money robbed at the house before the previous one (`n + prev`), or skipping the current house and taking the maximum amount from the previous house (`curr`). The maximum of these two scenarios is assigned to `temp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prev` and `curr` variables are then updated for the next iteration. `prev` is set to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` is set to the calculated `temp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is the value stored in the `curr` variable, representing the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at the last house. This value is returned as the result of the `rob` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided test cases at the end demonstrate the usage of the `rob` method with different input arrays."

The loop runs for each house, and the number of operations inside the loop is independent of the input size. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear, O(n).\n",

The variables `prev`, `curr`, and `temp` are the only additional variables used, and they do not depend on the size of the input array. Thus, the space complexity is constant, O(1).\n",
