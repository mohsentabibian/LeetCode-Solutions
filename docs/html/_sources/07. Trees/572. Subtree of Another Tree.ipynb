        "\n",
        "The time complexity of the code primarily depends on the recursive traversal of the binary tree. In both the `isSubtree` and `isSameTree` functions, we visit each node in the binary trees once. Let's break down the time complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `isSubtree` function:\n",
        "   - In the worst case, we need to visit every node in the `root` tree.\n",
        "   - For each node in the `root` tree, we call the `isSameTree` function, which has its own traversal.\n",
        "   - So, the total time complexity is $O(n * m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the `root` tree, and $m$ is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The `isSameTree` function:\n",
        "   - In the worst case, we visit every node in both `tree1` and `tree2`.\n",
        "   - The number of recursive calls made is proportional to the number of nodes in the trees.\n",
        "   - So, the time complexity of this function is $O(max(n, m))$, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of nodes in `tree1` and `tree2`, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the time complexity of the entire code is $O(n * m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the `root` tree, and $m$ is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree. In practice, it may be less than $O(n * m)$ if a subtree mismatch is detected early during the traversal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Space Complexity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The space complexity of the code is determined by the function call stack during recursion and the space used by the recursive functions. Let's analyze the space complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `isSubtree` function:\n",
        "   - It uses the call stack for recursion.\n",
        "   - The maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the height of the `root` tree, which can be $O(n)$ in the worst case (unbalanced tree).\n",
        "   - Additionally, the function doesn't use any significant extra space other than the recursion stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The `isSameTree` function:\n",
        "   - It also uses the call stack for recursion.\n",
        "   - The maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the height of the `tree1` or `tree2`, whichever is greater.\n",
        "   - So, the maximum space used for the call stack is $O(max(n, m))$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the space complexity of the code is $O(max(n, m))$ due to the function call stack. It scales with the maximum height of the trees being compared.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the code is efficient and works well for trees with moderate sizes. However, it's important to keep in mind that the worst-case time complexity is $O(n * m)$, so for very large trees, the performance may degrade."
