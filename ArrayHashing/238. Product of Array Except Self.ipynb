Two arrays, `left_products` and `right_products`, are created, each with a length of `n` and filled with ones initially.\n3. `left_product` is initialized to 1.\n4. A loop iterates through the `nums` array, from left to right. For each element at index `i`, it stores the product of all elements to its left (including itself) in the `left_products` array and updates `left_product` accordingly.\n5. `right_product` is initialized to 1.\n6. Another loop iterates through the `nums` array in reverse order, from right to left. For each element at index `i`, it stores the product of all elements to its right (including itself) in the `right_products` array and updates `right_product`.\n7. The final `answer` list is constructed by multiplying corresponding elements from the `left_products` and `right_products` arrays for each index `i`.\n8. The function returns the `answer` list, which contains the desired results.\n\nOverall, this algorithm efficiently computes the product of all elements except the current element, as required. It runs in O(n) time complexity and uses O(n) extra space, which is within the problem's constraints.",

The first loop iterates through the `nums` array to calculate the products to the left of each element. This loop runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the `nums` array.\n2. The second loop also iterates through the `nums` array in reverse order to calculate the products to the right of each element. This loop also runs in O(n) time.\n3. The final loop constructs the `answer` list by multiplying elements from the `left_products` and `right_products` arrays. This loop runs in O(n) time.\n\nSince all the loops are independent and sequential, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n1. Two additional arrays, `left_products` and `right_products`, are created with a length of `n`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. Therefore, these arrays consume O(n) extra space.\n2. The `left_product` and `right_product` variables are used to keep track of the product to the left and right of each element, respectively. These variables occupy O(1) extra space.\n3. The `answer` list, which contains the final results, also consumes O(n) space, but it's not counted toward the extra space complexity analysis as per the problem's constraints.\n\nOverall, the space complexity is O(n) for this solution.",
