      "source": "### Explanation:\n\n1. `def topKFrequent(nums, k):`: This is a function that takes two arguments: `nums`, which is the input array of integers, and `k`, which is the number of most frequent elements to return.\n\n2. `count = {}`: This dictionary `count` will be used to store the frequency of each unique element in the `nums` array. The keys are elements from the input array, and the values are their corresponding frequencies.\n\n3. `frequency = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]`: This creates a list of empty lists called `frequency`. It's used to store elements based on their frequencies, similar to the `freq` list in the previous code. The size of this list is set to be one greater than the length of the input `nums`.\n\n4. `for n in nums:`: This loop iterates through each element `n` in the input `nums` array.\n\n5. `count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)`: This line counts the frequency of each element `n` in the `nums` array. It uses the `count.get(n, 0)` method to retrieve the current count of `n` from the `count` dictionary. If `n` is not in the dictionary, it defaults to 0. It then increments the count by 1.\n\n6. After the above loop, the `count` dictionary will contain counts of each unique element in the `nums` array.\n\n7. `for n, c in count.items():`: This loop iterates through the items (key-value pairs) of the `count` dictionary. `n` represents the element, and `c` represents its frequency.\n\n8. `frequency[c].append(n)`: This line places the element `n` into the bucket corresponding to its frequency `c`. Buckets are represented by the `frequency` list. For example, if an element `n` has a frequency of 3, it will be added to `frequency[3]`.\n\n9. After this loop, the `frequency` list will contain buckets of elements grouped by their frequencies.\n\n10. `res = []`: This list `res` will be used to store the k most frequent elements.\n\n11. `for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):`: This loop iterates in reverse order through the `frequency` list, starting from the highest frequency and going down to 1. Note that there is a typo here; it should be `frequency` instead of `freq`.\n\n12. `for n in frequency[i]:`: For each element `n` in the current bucket (i.e., elements with frequency `i`), it appends `n` to the result list `res`.\n\n13. `if len(res) == k:`: Once `res` contains k elements, the code exits and returns the result.\n\nThe code efficiently finds the k most frequent elements in the input array without using sorting, similar to the previous explanation, with the only difference being the variable names (e.g., `frequency` instead of `freq`).",

The first loop that counts the frequency of elements by iterating through `nums` has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.\n\n2. The second loop iterates through the keys in the `count` dictionary, which has at most `k` unique elements (as per the constraints). Therefore, the second loop also has a time complexity of O(k).\n\n3. The third loop iterates through the `frequency` list, which has a length equal to the maximum frequency of elements in `nums`. In the worst case, this loop can have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.\n\nOverall, the dominant factor in terms of time complexity is the loop that iterates through the `count` dictionary. So, the total time complexity of the code is O(n + k).\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n1. The `count` dictionary stores the frequency of each unique element in `nums`. In the worst case, it can have at most `k` unique elements, so the space complexity for `count` is O(k).\n\n2. The `frequency` list is used to store elements grouped by their frequencies. It has a length of `len(nums) + 1`, which can be at most 105 based on the constraints. Therefore, the space complexity for `frequency` is O(105).\n\n3. The `res` list stores the k most frequent elements, which can be at most `k` elements, so the space complexity for `res` is O(k).\n\n**In summary**, the space complexity is dominated by the `count` dictionary and the `frequency` list, both of which have a space complexity of O(k + 105).",
