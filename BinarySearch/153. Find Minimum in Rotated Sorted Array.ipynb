Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\n\n**Difficulty:** Medium\n\n**Link to Problem:** [To see the Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array problem on LeetCode, click here!](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)\n\n---\n\nSuppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n\n- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.\n- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.\n\nNotice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array.*\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in $O(log\\ n)$ time.\n \n\n#### Constraints:\n\n- `n == nums.length`\n- `1 <= n <= 5000`\n- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`\n- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.\n- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.",

      "source": "### Explanation:\n\n1. The function `findMin(nums)` takes an input list `nums`, which represents the rotated sorted array.\n\n2. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to track the current search range. Initially, `left` is set to 0 (the beginning of the array), and `right` is set to `len(nums) - 1` (the end of the array).\n\n3. Enter a `while` loop with the condition `left < right`. This loop continues until `left` and `right` converge to a single element, which will be the minimum element in the rotated array.\n\n4. Inside the loop, calculate the middle index `mid` using integer division. This helps in finding the middle element of the current search range.\n\n5. Check if the element at the middle index (`nums[mid]`) is greater than the element at the rightmost index (`nums[right]`). If this condition is true, it means that the minimum element must be in the right half of the current search range. So, update `left` to `mid + 1`, effectively eliminating the left half of the search range.\n\n6. If the condition from step 5 is not met, it implies that the minimum element can be in the left half of the current search range or could be the element at the `mid` index itself. In this case, update `right` to `mid`, effectively eliminating the right half of the search range.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until `left` and `right` converge to the minimum element.\n\n8. When the loop exits, it means that `left` (or `right`) points to the minimum element in the array.\n\n9. Return `nums[left]` (or `nums[right]`) as the result, which is the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.",

This is because the binary search algorithm is employed, which continually divides the search range in half with each iteration.\n\nIn each iteration of the `while` loop, the search range is halved, and this process continues until the `left` and `right` pointers converge to the minimum element. In the worst case, it will take logarithmic time to reduce the search range to a single element.\n\nTherefore, the binary search used in this code runs in $O(log\\ n)$ time complexity.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\nThe space complexity of this code is $O(1)$, which means it uses a constant amount of additional space that does not depend on the size of the input array.\n\nThe algorithm uses a fixed number of variables (`left`, `right`, `mid`) to keep track of the search range and indices, but the number of these variables does not grow with the size of the input array. Hence, the space complexity is constant.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Time Complexity: $O(log\\ n)$\n- Space Complexity: $O(1)$",
