    "\n",
    "- `numCourses`: The total number of courses to be taken, labeled from 0 to `numCourses - 1`.\n",
    "- `prerequisites`: A list of prerequisite courses, where each element `prerequisites[i]` is a pair `[ai, bi]`, indicating that you must take course `bi` before you can take course `ai`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to check whether it's possible to complete all the courses while respecting the prerequisite requirements. In other words, you need to determine if there are any circular dependencies in the course prerequisites that would prevent you from taking all the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `numCourses` is 2, and `prerequisites` is `[[1, 0]]`, it means you have two courses, and you must finish course 0 before you can take course 1. In this case, it's possible to complete all courses, so the function should return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `numCourses` is 2, and `prerequisites` is `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`, it means you have two courses, but there's a circular dependency where course 1 requires course 0 and course 0 requires course 1. In this case, it's impossible to complete all courses, so the function should return `False`.\n",

    "## Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code is designed to determine whether it is possible to complete all the required courses given a set of prerequisites. It uses a topological sorting algorithm to accomplish this. Here's a brief explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code defines a `Solution` class with a `canFinish` method that takes two parameters: `numCourses` (the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of pairs indicating which course must be taken before another).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It initializes an empty graph as an adjacency list using a `defaultdict` to represent the courses and their prerequisites. It also initializes a list called `in_degree` to keep track of the in-degrees of courses, which is used in the topological sorting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code then populates the graph by iterating through the `prerequisites` list. For each pair `(ai, bi)`, it adds course `ai` as a neighbor to its prerequisite course `bi` in the graph and increments the in-degree of course `ai`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next, it initializes a queue with courses that have no prerequisites. It does this by iterating through all the courses and adding those with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The code performs a topological sorting of the courses using a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it dequeues a course from the front of the queue (a course with no prerequisites).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For each neighbor (course that depends on the dequeued course), it decrements the in-degree of the neighbor. If the neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it means all of its prerequisites have been taken, so the neighbor is added to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The loop continues until there are no more courses with no prerequisites to dequeue, and the in-degrees are updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After the loop, if all courses were successfully taken (i.e., `numCourses` becomes 0), it means that there were no circular dependencies, and it's possible to finish all courses. In this case, the method returns `True`. Otherwise, if there are remaining courses (indicating a circular dependency), it returns `False`."

    "\n",
    "3. Topological Sorting: In the while loop, we perform topological sorting, processing each course once and its outgoing edges. In the worst case, each course is processed once. This has a time complexity of O(V + E).\n",
