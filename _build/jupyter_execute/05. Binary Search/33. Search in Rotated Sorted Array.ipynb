    "## Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `search` function takes two arguments: `nums`, which is the rotated sorted array, and `target`, which is the value we want to find in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the range in which we are going to perform binary search. Initially, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to the index of the last element in the array (`len(nums) - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We start by finding the pivot index using binary search. The pivot index is the index at which the array is rotated. We use a `while` loop to continue the search until `left` is less than `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` using integer division. We then compare the value at `mid` with the value at `right`. If `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, it means the pivot point lies to the right of `mid`, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, the pivot point lies to the left of `mid`, so we update `right` to `mid`. This process continues until we find the pivot index.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After finding the pivot index, we have divided the array into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order but rotated. We need to determine which part of the array contains the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We reset `left` and `right` pointers. If the target value is within the range `[nums[pivot], nums[right]]`, we set `left` to `pivot` (the start of the rotated part), indicating that we should search in the rotated part. Otherwise, we set `right` to `pivot` (the end of the sorted part), indicating that we should search in the sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We then perform binary search again within the chosen range (`left` to `right`) to find the target element. The binary search continues until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Inside the binary search loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` and compare `nums[mid]` with the target value. If they are equal, we return `mid` as the index of the target element. If `nums[mid]` is less than the target, we update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half. If `nums[mid]` is greater than the target, we update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If we exit the binary search loop without finding the target, we return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array."
