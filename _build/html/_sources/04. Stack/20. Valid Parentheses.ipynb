        "## Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We start by defining the `isValid` function that takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string containing parentheses and brackets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inside the function, we create an empty stack, which is a list in Python, to store opening brackets as we encounter them in the input string. The stack will help us keep track of the brackets and their order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We define a `bracket_mapping` dictionary that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This mapping will be used to check if a closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket in the stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. We iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s` using a `for` loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. If the character `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists in the `values()` of `bracket_mapping`), we push it onto the stack using the `append()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. If the character `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., it exists in the `keys()` of `bracket_mapping`), we need to check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket. To do this, we pop the top element from the stack (if it exists) and store it in `top_element`. We use a dummy value `'#'` if the stack is empty to avoid errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. We then compare `top_element` with the corresponding opening bracket using `bracket_mapping[char]`. If they do not match, it means the string is not valid, and we return `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. If the character `char` is not a bracket, we simply ignore it and continue the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. After processing the entire string, we check if there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been properly matched and closed, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Finally, we provide some test cases at the bottom of the code to demonstrate how the function works for different input strings."
