        "The provided code defines a Python class `Solution` with two methods for merging k sorted linked lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode`: This method takes a list of k sorted linked lists as input and returns a single merged sorted linked list. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to repeatedly merge pairs of lists until only one merged list remains.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `mergeList(self, l1, l2)`: This method takes two sorted linked lists, `l1` and `l2`, as input and merges them into a single sorted linked list. It uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a high-level overview of how the code works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `mergeKLists` method checks if the input list of linked lists is empty or contains no lists. If there are no lists, it returns `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inside a `while` loop, the code repeatedly merges pairs of linked lists until only one merged list remains in the `lists` array. It does this by iterating through the input lists in pairs and calling the `mergeList` method to merge each pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `mergeList` method takes two sorted linked lists, `l1` and `l2`, and merges them into a single sorted linked list. It uses a dummy node (`dummy`) and a `tail` pointer to keep track of the merged list while comparing and merging elements from `l1` and `l2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- After merging all pairs of lists and updating the `lists` array with the merged results, the loop continues until only one merged list remains in the `lists` array.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Finally, the `mergeKLists` method returns the merged list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this code efficiently merges k sorted linked lists using a divide-and-conquer strategy, resulting in a single merged sorted linked list as the output."

        "\n",
        "**Time Complexity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Heap Initialization:** The code does not use a heap. Instead, it uses a divide-and-conquer approach. The initial check for empty input lists takes $O(1)$ time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Merging:** The merging operation is performed in a divide-and-conquer fashion. In each iteration of the `while` loop, we merge pairs of linked lists, and the number of comparisons made is proportional to the total number of nodes across all the linked lists ($n$). In each merge step, we effectively process each node once. The number of iterations required to reduce k lists to 1 is $O(log\\ k)$.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Merged Lists:** In the `mergeList` method, we create a new merged list. However, this list is not stored in memory for all lists; it's replaced with each merged pair. The space used for these merged lists is proportional to the size of the largest merged list, which is $O(n)$ in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Additional Variables:** The code uses a few additional variables, such as `dummy` and `tail`, but these occupy a constant amount of space and don't depend on the input size.\n",

        "   Therefore, the overall space complexity of the code is $O(n)$, where n is the total number of nodes across all lists.\n",
