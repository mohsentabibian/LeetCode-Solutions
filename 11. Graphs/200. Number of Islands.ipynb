        "\n",
        "The problem is about counting the number of islands in a 2D binary grid. In this grid, '1' represents land, and '0' represents water. An island is defined as a group of '1' cells that are adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically. It's important to note that diagonal connections do not count. Additionally, it's assumed that all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water, meaning the grid is finite and doesn't \"wrap around.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to determine how many distinct islands exist in the grid. To clarify, an island consists of connected '1' cells, and these connections can only occur horizontally or vertically. If there are no '1' cells in the grid, the number of islands would be zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem often involves using graph traversal techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify and count these islands. You start at one '1' cell and explore its adjacent cells to determine the extent of the island. Once you've visited all the '1' cells in an island, you move on to the next unvisited '1' cell and repeat the process until you've counted all the islands in the grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the problem asks you to analyze the grid to find groups of connected '1' cells and count them as individual islands. The goal is to return the total count of islands in the given grid.\n",

        "The provided code defines a Python class called `Solution` with a method called `numIslands`. This class is designed to count the number of islands in a 2D binary grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `numIslands` method takes a 2D grid as input, where '1' represents land, and '0' represents water. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to identify and count islands. The key steps in the code include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Checking if the input grid is empty, and if so, returning 0 (indicating there are no islands).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Determining the dimensions of the grid (number of rows and columns).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Initializing a variable `num_islands` to keep track of the count of islands.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Defining a nested function `dfs` to perform depth-first search. This function recursively explores adjacent land cells connected to the current cell and marks them as visited by changing '1' to '0'.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. In the `dfs` function, it checks for boundary conditions and whether the current cell is '0'. If these conditions are met, it returns without further exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The `dfs` function explores neighboring cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) using a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The main loop iterates through each cell of the grid. When a '1' cell is encountered, it increments the `num_islands` count and starts a DFS from that cell to explore the entire island.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Finally, the method returns the total count of islands found in the grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code encapsulates the solution in a class, allowing you to create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numIslands` method on it to count the number of islands in a given grid."
