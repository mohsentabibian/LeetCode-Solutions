    "- You are given an undirected graph, which consists of nodes and edges. The graph may have multiple distinct connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A connected component is a group of nodes within the graph where each node can be reached from every other node in the same component. In other words, there is a path between any two nodes in the same connected component, but there are no paths connecting nodes from different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is to write a function that takes as input the number of nodes `n` and a list of edges `edges`, where each edge is represented as a pair of nodes `[a, b]` indicating an edge between node `a` and node `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to determine the number of distinct connected components in the graph.\n",

    "## Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python code calculates the number of connected components in an undirected graph. Here's a high-level explanation of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `countConnectedComponents` function takes two arguments: `n` (the number of nodes in the graph) and `edges` (a list of edge pairs representing connections between nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the function, there is a helper function called `dfs` (depth-first search), which is used to explore and mark nodes as visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An empty adjacency list called `graph` is created to represent the graph. The `graph` is a list of lists where each element represents a node, and the list associated with each node contains its neighboring nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Another list called `visited` is created to keep track of visited nodes. Initially, all nodes are marked as not visited (`False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The code populates the `graph` by iterating through the `edges` list and adding each edge to the adjacency list. Since the graph is undirected, both directions of each edge are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A counter variable called `count` is initialized to keep track of the number of connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The code iterates through all nodes from `0` to `n-1`. For each node, it checks whether it has been visited yet. If it hasn't been visited, it means a new connected component is found. The counter `count` is incremented, and a depth-first search (DFS) is initiated from this unvisited node to explore the connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `dfs` function recursively visits all nodes in the connected component, marking them as visited. It does this by checking each neighbor of the current node and recursively calling `dfs` on unvisited neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. After the loop through all nodes, the `count` variable contains the total number of connected components in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The function returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Two examples are provided at the end to demonstrate how to use the function with different inputs."

    "## Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the code for counting the number of connected components in an undirected graph using depth-first search (DFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "- The code iterates through all nodes in the graph (from 0 to `n-1`).\n",
    "- For each unvisited node, it initiates a depth-first search (DFS) from that node to explore the connected component.\n",
    "- In the worst case, every node may belong to a separate connected component, and you perform a DFS for each node.\n",
    "- The time complexity of the DFS for a single connected component is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes in the component, and E is the number of edges.\n",
    "- In the worst case, you perform O(n) DFS calls, each with its own O(V + E) complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n * (V + E)). In the worst case, if the graph is connected (a single connected component), this simplifies to O(n * (n + m)), where m is the number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "- The main data structures used are the `graph` (adjacency list), `visited` (boolean array), and the recursive call stack for DFS.\n",
    "- The `graph` has a space complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.\n",
    "- The `visited` boolean array also has a space complexity of O(n) to keep track of whether nodes have been visited.\n",
    "- The depth of the recursive call stack for DFS can go up to O(n) in the worst case, when all nodes are part of a single connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the overall space complexity of the code is O(n + m) for data structures and O(n) for the call stack. In the worst case, this simplifies to O(n + m).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the time complexity is O(n * (V + E)), and the space complexity is O(n + m)."

    "1. **Disconnected Components with Multiple Queries:** You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. Initially, the graph is disconnected, and you need to process `q` queries. Each query consists of adding an edge to connect two nodes. After each query, you need to output the number of connected components in the updated graph.\n",
