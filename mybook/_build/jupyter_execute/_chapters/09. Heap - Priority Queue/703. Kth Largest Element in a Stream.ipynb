    "## Probelm Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem you're trying to solve is to design a class called `KthLargest` that can efficiently find the kth largest element in a stream of integers. You need to support two main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, you can use a min-heap data structure. Here's how the approach works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a min-heap to store the k largest elements. Initially, it's empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the `__init__` method, populate the min-heap with the first `k` elements from `nums`. This ensures that you have the k largest elements seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Whenever you add a new element to the stream using the `add` method, follow these steps:\n",
    "   - Add the new element to the min-heap.\n",
    "   - If the size of the min-heap exceeds `k`, remove the smallest element from the min-heap. This ensures that you always have the k largest elements in the min-heap.\n",
    "   - The smallest element in the min-heap (the root) will always represent the kth largest element in the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this approach works efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using a min-heap, you can quickly maintain the k largest elements, and finding the smallest element in the heap (the root) takes constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you add a new element, the min-heap's size is kept at most `k`, which ensures that you only track the k largest elements and discard the smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity for adding an element is O(log k), which is very efficient compared to sorting the entire stream, which would be O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This approach meets the constraints of the problem, including handling large streams and having a low time complexity for both initialization and adding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the min-heap approach efficiently tracks the kth largest element in the stream by maintaining a heap of the k largest elements seen so far, updating it as new elements are added. This approach provides a fast and scalable solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",

    "- We start by importing the necessary modules:\n",
    "  - `heapq`: This module provides functions to create and manipulate heaps.\n",
    "  - `List` from the `typing` module: This is used to specify the type of the `nums` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define the `KthLargest` class:\n",
    "  - The `__init__` method initializes the object with the integer `k` and the list of integers `nums`.\n",
    "  - It also creates an empty min-heap called `self.min_heap` to store the k largest elements.\n",
    "  - It populates the min-heap with the first `k` elements from `nums` by calling the `add` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `add` method:\n",
    "  - Adds the new integer `val` to the min-heap using `heapq.heappush`. This maintains the min-heap property.\n",
    "  - Checks if the size of the min-heap exceeds `k`. If it does, it removes the smallest element (the k+1th largest) using `heapq.heappop`.\n",
    "  - Finally, it returns the smallest element in the min-heap, which is always the kth largest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code implements a class that efficiently finds the kth largest element in a stream of integers by maintaining a min-heap of the k largest elements seen so far.\n"

    "## Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the `KthLargest` class using the min-heap approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__init__` method:\n",
    "   - In the `__init__` method, you iterate over the first `k` elements in `nums` and add them to the min-heap. Each `heapq.heappush` operation takes O(log k) time.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the time complexity of the `__init__` method is O(k * log k).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `add` method:\n",
    "   - In the `add` method, you perform the following operations:\n",
    "     - `heapq.heappush`: O(log k) to add the new element to the min-heap.\n",
    "     - If the size of the min-heap exceeds `k`, you perform `heapq.heappop`, which is also O(log k).\n",
    "     - Finally, you return the smallest element from the min-heap, which is O(1) because it's always the root.\n",
    "   - Overall, the time complexity of the `add` method is O(log k).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overall, if you make `n` calls to the `add` method, the total time complexity is O(n * log k), where `n` is the total number of elements added to the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The space complexity is determined by the space used to store the min-heap and the instance variables.\n",
    "2. The min-heap stores at most `k` elements at any given time, so its space complexity is O(k).\n",
    "3. The instance variables (such as `self.k` and `self.min_heap`) have constant space requirements.\n",
    "4. Therefore, the overall space complexity of the `KthLargest` class is O(k).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the time complexity of the `KthLargest` class is O(n * log k) for `n` add operations, and the space complexity is O(k), where `k` is the parameter passed during initialization. This implementation efficiently maintains the kth largest element in the stream while meeting the problem's constraints."

    "## Challenging Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic k:** Modify the `KthLargest` class to support dynamic changes in the value of `k`. Implement a method `update_k` that allows changing the value of `k` during the lifetime of the object. Ensure that the object can still correctly find the kth largest element based on the updated value of `k`.\n",

    "2. **Implement kth Smallest:** Create a new class called `KthSmallest` that finds the kth smallest element in a stream instead of the kth largest. You may need to modify the data structure used in the implementation."
