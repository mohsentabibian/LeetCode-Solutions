    "## Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start with initializing `max_area` to 0, which will store the maximum area of water that can be contained by the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to the beginning and end of the input `height` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main loop runs while `left` is less than `right`. This ensures that we are checking all possible pairs of lines in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the loop:\n",
    "   - We calculate the height of the container `h` as the minimum of the heights at the `left` and `right` pointers. This represents the height of the water the container can hold.\n",
    "   - We calculate the width of the container as the difference between `right` and `left`. This represents the distance between the two lines.\n",
    "   - We calculate the area of the container using `h * width` and update `max_area` if the calculated area is greater than the current `max_area`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After calculating the area and updating `max_area`, we move one of the pointers. We move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward because moving the pointer pointing to the taller line won't increase the height and will only decrease the width, which will result in a smaller area.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We continue this process until `left` is no longer less than `right`, indicating that we have checked all possible pairs of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finally, we return the `max_area` which contains the maximum area of water that can be contained by two lines from the input array."

    "## Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the `maxArea` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "The function uses a two-pointer approach to find the maximum area of water. In the worst case, both the left and right pointers traverse the entire input array once. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `height` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "The function uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `max_area`, `left`, `right`, `h`, and `width`. It does not use any data structures whose space consumption depends on the input size. As a result, the space complexity is O(1), which means it has constant space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary,** the `maxArea` function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum area of water that can be contained by two lines in the input array."

    "1. **Optimization Challenge:** Modify the maxArea function to not only return the maximum area but also the indices of the two lines that form the container with the maximum area.\n",
    "2. **Variant Problem:** Instead of finding the maximum area of water, find the minimum amount of water required to fill all the gaps between the lines. You'll need to return the total water volume needed."
