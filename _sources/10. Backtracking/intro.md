# Introduction to Backtracking Challenges

Welcome to the Backtracking section of "Hands-On Problem-Solving in Python: Mastering the Blind 75 LeetCode Challenges." Backtracking is a powerful technique employed in algorithmic problem-solving, enabling us to explore and find solutions to combinatorial problems efficiently.

## Unraveling the Backtracking Paradigm

Backtracking is a systematic way of searching through all possible solutions to a problem and systematically discarding those that do not satisfy the problem constraints. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of backtracking and apply it to two fascinating challenges.

## Discover the Challenges

1. **Combination Sum (Problem #39):** Explore the world of combinations as we navigate through the possibilities of summing up to a target value. This challenge will sharpen your ability to generate combinations and filter out the valid ones.

2. **Word Search (Problem #79):** Embark on a journey through a grid of letters, uncovering words hidden within. This challenge not only tests your backtracking skills but also introduces you to the realm of searching for words efficiently.

## Navigating the README
