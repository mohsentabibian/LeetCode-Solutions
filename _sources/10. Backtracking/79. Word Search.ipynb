        "## Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Import the necessary module:\n",
        "   - `from typing import List`: This line imports the `List` type from the `typing` module, which is used to specify the type of the `board` parameter in the method signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Define the `Solution` class:\n",
        "   - `class Solution:`: This line defines a class called `Solution` to encapsulate the solution for the word search problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Define the `exist` method:\n",
        "   - `def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:`: This method is a member of the `Solution` class and takes two parameters: `board`, which is a 2D list of characters, and `word`, which is a string. It returns a boolean value, indicating whether the word exists in the board.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implement the inner `dfs` function:\n",
        "   - `def dfs(i, j, k):`: This is a helper function used for depth-first search (DFS). It is called recursively to explore the board and search for the word. It takes three parameters: `i` and `j` representing the current position on the board, and `k` representing the current index in the `word` string.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Inside `dfs`, it checks if the current position is out of bounds or if the character at the current position on the board does not match the character at the current index in the `word`. If either of these conditions is met, it returns `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If `k` is equal to the length of the `word` minus one, it means we have successfully matched all characters in the `word`, so it returns `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The function then temporarily replaces the character at the current position with a marker, \"/\", to prevent revisiting the same cell. It then explores adjacent cells by making recursive calls in all four directions: up, down, left, and right. If any of these recursive calls return `True`, it propagates the `True` result up the call stack. After the exploration is complete, it restores the original character in the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Iterate through the board:\n",
        "   - The outer loop iterates through all cells in the `board` using two nested loops. For each cell, it checks if the `dfs` function starting from that cell (with `k` initially set to 0) returns `True`. If it does, it means the word exists, so the method returns `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Return `False`:\n",
        "   - If the loop completes without finding the word in the board, the method returns `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this code, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `exist` method on that instance, passing the `board` and the `word` as arguments to check if the word exists in the board."

        "The primary work in this code is done by the `dfs` function, which performs a depth-first search through the grid. The time complexity of the `dfs` function is $O(4^(n))$, where \"n\" is the length of the `word`. This is because, in the worst case, the function explores all possible directions (up, down, left, right) for each character in the `word`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outer loops iterate through all cells in the `board`, which has dimensions `m x n`. So, the total number of iterations of `dfs` is O(m * n). However, since the `dfs` function has a higher time complexity, the overall time complexity is still dominated by the `dfs` function.\n",
