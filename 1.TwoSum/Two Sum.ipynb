The function uses recursive traversal to compare the trees' structures and values.\n\n1. We start by defining a `TreeNode` class, which represents a node in a binary tree. Each node has a `val` (the node's value), a `left` child, and a right child. This class will help us create and work with binary trees.\n2. Next, we define the `isSameTree` function, which checks if two binary trees (`p` and `q`) are the same.\n      + The base case for the recursion is when both `p` and `q` are `None`. In this case, they are considered the same, so we return `True`.\n      + If either `p` or `q` is `None` (but not both), they cannot be the same, so we return `False`.\n      + If the values of the current nodes `p.val` and `q.val` are not equal, we return `False` because the trees cannot be the same.\n      + Finally, we recursively check the left and right subtrees of `p` and `q` to see if they are the same.",
